    _This reflects how well teams, which have traditionally been siloed, interact in development, operations, 
    and information security. See Chapters 3 and 5._

    _**Collaboration in the Context of Practicing Devops**_
    
    _Collaboration is the practice of multiple individuals working together, building toward a specific outcome. 
    Effective collaboration within the enterprise isn’t like a school project gone awry in which one person dominates 
    everyone else’s efforts, ignoring other people’s inputs and opinions in pursuit of their own good grade. It also
    isn’t about some people picking up the slack for others who have checked out. Instead, it’s about people coming 
    together from different perspectives, and everyone providing input so that you can come to a shared understanding 
    with a collective team perspective. **Collaboration is about building trust, empathy, and team psychological safety
    in an environment that often requires you to work with many people for short periods of time to get work done**._
    
    _Software **development** and **operations** teams working together is a core part of the **devops** movement. 
    Before one team can successfully work with another team that has a different focus, the individuals on both teams 
    need to be able to work with each other. Teams that don’t work well on an individual or intrateam level have little 
    hope of working well at the interteam level._ 

### Examples & use cases

!!! tip "Ways to improve your learning culture" 
    You can help your organization create a climate for learning by viewing learning as the key to improvement and as an
    investment. Some steps you can take to directly support learning include:

    - [x] **Create a training budget, and advocate for it internally.** _Emphasize how much the organization values a climate
     of learning by putting resources behind formal education opportunities._

    - [x] **Ensure that your team has the resources to engage in informal learning and the space to explore ideas.** 
    _Learning often happens outside of formal education. Some companies, like 3M and Google, set aside a portion of time
    for focused free-thinking and exploration of side projects._
    
    - [x] **Make it safe to fail. If failure is punished, people won't try new things.** _Treat failures as 
    opportunities to learn, and hold blameless post-mortems to work out how to improve processes and systems. Help
    people feel comfortable taking reasonable risks, and create a culture of innovation._
    
    - [x] **Create opportunities and spaces to share information.** _Whether you hold weekly lightning talks or offer
     resources for monthly lunch-and-learns, set up a regular cadence of opportunities for employees to share their
     knowledge._
    
    - [x] **Make resources available for continued education.** _For example, attending conferences is important for 
    both exposure to new technology and case studies, as well as networking with peers._
    
    - [x] **Encourage people to get certifications or external trainings.** You can help with this by covering costs of
    external trainings and forming study groups that are a part of normal work activity.
