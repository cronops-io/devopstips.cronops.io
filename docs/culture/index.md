## Overview

1st and foremost we'll need to understand that **DevOps is a cultural shift**, It’s not a matter of simply adopting agile 
project planning or automated testing, continuos integration and continuous delivery, although those practices are 
certainly important and part of the overall DevOps picture. 

DevOps culture is more about a shared understanding between Developers, QA, Product Management, InfoSec and Operations, 
and sharing responsibility for the software they build and deliver. That means continuously improving and maturing 
communication, transparency, and collaboration across all IT aforementioned teams and "the business".

!!! tip "The Challenge"    
    Like any big and deep change, building a DevOps culture can be challenging and even scary for some people. 
    We get this point. But we’ve been learning through our own experience (and all the projects we've actively participated)
    that possibly the two main factors (among others that we'll develop in [DevOpsTips](../welcome.md)) are:
    
    * [x] Clarity around both teams and business expectations
    * [x] An environment of psychological safety :pray:

    Without them, teams tend tend to fall in _**"The Code, Chronic Conflict"**_ :point_down:

!!! cite "_"The Code, Chronic Conflict"_, as detailed in the [DevOps Handbook]((https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-devops-handbook/9781457191381/))"
    _In almost every IT organization, there is an inherent conflict between Development and IT Operations which creates 
    a downward spiral, resulting in ever-slower time to market for new products and features, reduced quality, increased
    outages, and, worst of all, an ever-increasing amount of technical debt. making mistakes – and, worse, not learn
    from them._

!!! warning "Outcome"
    Without considering the factors mentioned above, teams tend repeat these mistakes. And, worse, not learn from them. 
    We hope that following [CronOps DevOpsTips](https://devopstips.cronops.io) should make your team’s DevOps journey a 
    lot easier.
