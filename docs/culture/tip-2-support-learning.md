    _Is learning, in your culture, considered essential for continued progress? 
    Is learning thought of as a cost or an investment? This is a measure of an organizationâ€™s learning culture._

    _Research from the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) (PDF) team shows that an organizational culture that values
     learning contributes to software delivery performance with the following:_

    - _Increased deployment frequency_
    - _Reduced lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure rate_
    - _Strong team culture_
    
    _The climate for learning in your organization is directly related to the extent to which your organization treats 
    learning as strategic:_

    - _Does your organization view learning as an investment necessary for growth?_
    - _Is learning seen as a necessary burden, undertaken only grudgingly?_
    - _Is learning completely avoided?_
    
    _Research done in other areas, such as accounting, has also shown that a climate for learning is predictive of
    performance gains._ 

### Examples & use cases

!!! tip "Practices to create a generative culture" 
    You can help your organization create a climate for learning by viewing learning as the key to improvement and as an
    investment. Some steps you can take to directly support learning include:

    - [x] **Create a training budget, and advocate for it internally.** _Emphasize how much the organization values a climate
     of learning by putting resources behind formal education opportunities._

    - [x] **Ensure that your team has the resources to engage in informal learning and the space to explore ideas.** 
    _Learning often happens outside of formal education. Some companies, like 3M and Google, set aside a portion of time
    for focused free-thinking and exploration of side projects._
    
    - [x] **Make it safe to fail. If failure is punished, people won't try new things.** _Treat failures as 
    opportunities to learn, and hold blameless post-mortems to work out how to improve processes and systems. Help
    people feel comfortable taking reasonable risks, and create a culture of innovation._
    
    - [x] **Create opportunities and spaces to share information.** _Whether you hold weekly lightning talks or offer
     resources for monthly lunch-and-learns, set up a regular cadence of opportunities for employees to share their
     knowledge._
    
    - [x] **Make resources available for continued education.** _For example, attending conferences is important for 
    both exposure to new technology and case studies, as well as networking with peers._
    
    - [x] **Encourage people to get certifications or external trainings.** You can help with this by covering costs of
    external trainings and forming study groups that are a part of normal work activity.
