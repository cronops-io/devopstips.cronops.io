# DevOps Culture 

## Tip 1 | Support a generative culture 

!!! cite "From :earth_americas: [Google Cloud **DevOps culture** | Westrum organizational culture](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture)"
    _According to research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), organizational culture that is **high-trust** and 
    emphasizes **information flow** is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in 
    technology. The idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes is not a new
     idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. His research included human factors in system 
     safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.
    In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a culture influences the way 
    information flows through an organization. Westrum provides three characteristics of good information:_
    
    1. _It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered._
    2. _It is timely._
    3. _It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively._

### Examples & use cases

!!! tip "Practices to create a generative culture" 
    To improve information flow and trust you'll need to consider the six aspects of 
    Westrum's model of organizational culture:
    
    * [x] _**High cooperation.** Create cross-functional teams that include representatives from each functional area of 
    the software delivery process (business analysts, developers, quality engineers, ops, security, and so on). 
    This practice lets everyone share the responsibility for building, deploying, and maintaining a product. 
    It's also important that there is good cooperation within the team._
    
    * [x] _**Messengers are trained.** This means we want people to bring us bad news so we can make things better. 
    Hold blameless postmortems. By removing blame, you remove fear; and by removing fear, you enable teams to surface 
    problems and solve them more effectively. Also create and foster an environment where it is safe to take smart 
    risks and fail, so that anyone can surface problems at any time—even without the ceremony of a postmortem._
     
    * [x] _**Risks are shared.** Along with this, encourage shared responsibilities. Quality, availability, reliability
     and security are everyone's job. One way to improve the quality of your services is to ensure that developers share
     responsibility for maintaining their code in production. The improvement in collaboration that comes from sharing
     responsibility inherently reduces risk: The more eyes on the software delivery process, the more you'll avoid
     errors in process or planning. Automation also reduces risk, and with the right tool choice, can enable
     collaboration._
     
    * [x] _**Bridging is encouraged.** Break down silos. In addition to creating cross-functional teams, techniques for 
    breaking down silos include co-locating ops with the dev team; including ops in planning throughout the software
    delivery lifecycle; and implementing ChatOps. Another tip is to identify someone in the organization whose work
    you don't understand (or whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or lunch. Informal
    discussions help foster better communication, and you may understand why they do what they do—and you can come up
    with creative solutions together._
    
    * [x] _**Failure leads to inquiry.** Again, hold blameless postmortems. The response to failure shapes the culture
    of an organization. Blaming individuals for failures creates a negative culture. If instead, failures lead you to
    ask questions about what caused the failures and how you can keep them from happening again in the future, you've
    improved your technical system, your processes, and your culture._
    
    * [x] _**Novelty is implemented.** Encourage experimentation. Giving employees freedom to explore new ideas can lead
    to great outcomes. Some companies give engineers time each week for experimentation. Others host internal hack days
    or mini-conferences to share ideas and collaborate. Many new features and products began this way. When you release
    your employees from habitual pathways and repetitive tasks, they can generate enormous value for your organization.
    And remember that novelty isn't limited to new products and features. Also encourage and reward improvements in
    process and ideas that help foster collaboration._
