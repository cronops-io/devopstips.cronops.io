    _According to research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), organizational culture that is high-trust and 
    emphasizes information flow is predictive of software delivery performance and organizational performance in 
    technology. The idea that a good culture that optimizes information flow is predictive of good outcomes is not a new
     idea; it is based on research by sociologist Dr. Ron Westrum. Westrum's research included human factors in system 
     safety, particularly in the context of accidents in technological domains such as aviation and healthcare.
    In his work with these high risk, highly complex fields, Westrum noted that such a culture influences the way 
    information flows through an organization. Westrum provides three characteristics of good information:
    1. It provides answers to the questions that the receiver needs answered.
    2. It is timely.
    3. It is presented in such a way that the receiver can use it effectively._

    _Support a generative culture (as outlined by Westrum). This measure of organizational culture is based on a typology
    developed by Ron Westrum, a sociologist who studied safety-critical complex systems in the domains of aviation and 
    healthcare. Our research has found that this measure of culture is predictive of IT performance, organizational 
    performance, and decreasing burnout. Hallmarks of this measure include good information flow, high cooperation and 
    trust, bridging between teams, and conscious inquiry. See Chapter 3._
