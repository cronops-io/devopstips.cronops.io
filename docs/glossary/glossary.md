    * :star: **DevOps:** _"is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and 
    leadership to the IT value stream. DevOps relies on bodies of knowledge from Lean, Theory of Constraints, the Toyota
    Production System, resilience engineering, learning organizations, safety culture, human factors, and many others. 
    Other valuable contexts that DevOps draws from include high-trust management cultures, servant leadership, and
    organizational change management. The result is world-class quality, reliability, stability, and security at ever 
    lower cost and effort; and accelerated flow and reliability throughout the technology value stream, including 
    Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations, and Infosec."_
